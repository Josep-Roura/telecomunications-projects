## üõ†Ô∏è 3. Configuration

### Step 1: Telegram Bot Setup
1. Open **Telegram** and search for `@BotFather`.
2. Use the command `/newbot` and follow the instructions to create a new bot.
3. Save the **bot token** provided.
4. Add the bot to your Telegram group and send any message in the group.
5. Use this URL to obtain your **group ID**:
```
https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates
```
6. Copy the **group ID** from the JSON response.

### Step 2: System Configuration
In the `main.py` file, modify the following values:

```python
# Configuration
MY_IP = "<YOUR_LOCAL_IP>"       # Your local IP address
REQUEST_THRESHOLD = 5            # Max requests allowed within the time window
TIME_WINDOW = 5                  # Time window (in seconds) for request analysis
BLOCK_TIME = 15                  # Block duration for repeated alerts

# Telegram Configuration
TOKEN = "<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>"
CHAT_ID = "<YOUR_GROUP_ID>"
```

**Note:** Your IP address can be found using the `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux/Mac) command.

## üìã 5. Understanding the Output

### Terminal Output Example
```
Incoming Traffic - Source IP: 192.168.1.20 --> Destination IP: 192.168.1.34 ; Time: 2025-03-08 13:34:22
ALERT: The IP 192.168.1.20 has sent 8 requests in the last 5 seconds.
```

### Telegram Alert Example
```
ALERT: The IP 192.168.1.20 has sent 8 requests in the last 5 seconds.
```

### Log File Output (`alerts.txt`)
```
ALERT: The IP 192.168.1.20 has sent 8 requests in the last 5 seconds.

## üêû 6. Troubleshooting

### Problem: The script doesn't detect any traffic.
‚úÖ Ensure you are connected to the correct network.  
‚úÖ Verify that your IP address in `MY_IP` is correct.  
‚úÖ Try running the script with **Administrator privileges**.  

### Problem: No alerts are sent to Telegram.
‚úÖ Check that the **bot token** and **group ID** are correctly configured.  
‚úÖ Ensure your bot has been added to the Telegram group and has permission to send messages.  

### Problem: The log file (`alerts.txt`) remains empty.
‚úÖ Ensure the file path is correct.  
‚úÖ Verify that the script is not constantly overwriting the file.  
‚úÖ Add `file.flush()` in the `write_alert()` function if delays occur.

## ‚ùì 7. FAQs

**Q: Can this system detect outgoing DDoS attacks from my network?**  
A: No, this system is designed to monitor **incoming traffic only** to detect possible DDoS attacks targeting your IP address.

**Q: Can I adjust the request threshold or block time?**  
A: Yes, modify the values in the `main.py` configuration section to suit your network environment.

**Q: What happens if an IP keeps sending requests after being blocked?**  
A: The IP will remain blocked until the block timer expires. You can adjust the `BLOCK_TIME` value for longer or shorter delays.

**Q: Does the system require Administrator or Root permissions?**  
A: Yes, in some environments `Scapy` may require elevated permissions to access network interfaces correctly.
